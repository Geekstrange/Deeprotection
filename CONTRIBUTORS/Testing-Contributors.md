## **Testing Contributors**

- **Explanation** : Testing contributors are responsible for evaluating the project's quality and reliability. They perform various testing activities such as unit testing (testing individual components of the software), integration testing (testing how different parts of the software work together), and system testing (testing the complete and integrated software product). They report bugs, identify issues in the project's functionality and performance, and help ensure that the project meets the required quality standards.
