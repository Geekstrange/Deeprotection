## Documentation Contributors
- **Explanation** : Documentation contributors focus on creating and maintaining project documentation. This can include writing user guides to help end - users understand how to use the project's features, developing technical documentation for developers to explain the project's code structure, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and other technical details. They also may be involved in updating documentation as the project evolves to keep it accurate and useful for the target audience.
